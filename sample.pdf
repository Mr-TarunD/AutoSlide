Machine learning (ML) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.

There are several main types of machine learning. Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known. The algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with the desired outputs to find errors, and then modifying the model accordingly. In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms are given unlabeled data. The algorithm must find structure in the input data, suchc as grouping or clustering data points. Finally, reinforcement learning involves an agent that interacts with a dynamic environment, learning to perform certain tasks by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.
